# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Plugin

![](SpatialGDK/Documentation/spatialos-gdkforunreal-header.png)

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is an Unreal Engine plugin which gives you the features of [SpatialOS](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/latest), within the familiar workflows and APIs of Unreal Engine. For more information, please see the GDK's [documentation website](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest).
  
If you’re an Unreal game developer and you’re ready to try out the GDK, follow the [Get started guide](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/content/get-started/introduction). 

> The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal is in alpha. It is ready to use for development of single-server games, but not recommended for public releases. We are committed to rapid development of the GDK to provide a performant release - for information on this, see our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and [Unreal features support](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/unreal-features-support) pages, and contact us via our forums, or on Discord.

## Where to get the GDK and related projects
The GDK and its related projects are available on GitHub.
* [GDK: github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK)
* [The SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine)
* [The Example Project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject) 

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we have made a number of small changes to the UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine).

> In order to get access to this fork, you need to link your GitHub account to a verified Epic Games account, and to have agreed to Epic's license. You will not be able to use the GDK for Unreal without doing this first. To do this, see the [Unreal documentation](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).

## Recommended use
The GDK is in [alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) so we can react to feedback and iterate on development quickly. To facilitate this, during our alpha stage we don't have a formal deprecation cycle for APIs and workflows. This means that everything and anything can change.

We recommend using the GDK in projects in the early production or prototype stage. This ensures that your project's requirements are in line with the GDK's timeline.

## Versioning and support
Please visit [this page](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/content/pricing-and-support/versioning-scheme) for a description of the GDK's versioning scheme, and which branches to use when developing.
